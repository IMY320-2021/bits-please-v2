They make use of a compass on their phone which acts as their only source of light but the battery needs to be used sparingly since this is also the only way to stay on the path and keep your character's mental health good, the use of the character's heartbeat, breathing and phone helps the player know if they are on the right path to find their sibling and exit the forest, when dwelling off of the path you risk your characters mentality and increase the risk of running into a monster and getting killed.`,

                    Harmony is more than just an AI to identify food, we also have a social media aspect, allowing users to view pairings feed style, upvote, downvote or favourite them and also create pairings of their own. We also cater to businesses, they can use our recommendations system to view what pairings and tags are most likely to gain popularity and leverage this to create custom adverts that also appear to users within a custom radius of their shop.`,
